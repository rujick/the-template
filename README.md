The Template
============

I am a software developer, and I have used GitHub in that capacity multiple times before. This project is one of the attempts of trying to use GitHub for collaborative writing projects (or even for single-author writing projects).

This project you are in is a template that you can import, and start working with it right away.

# What is a GitHub?

If this is the first time you try GitHub, have no fear; you don't need to learn a lot to make the best use of it for writing.

At its core, GitHub is a hosting service. Its primary purpose is to host software development projects. In that regard, it is no different than any other hosting services.

However, it also has one very important and very powerful feature: version control.

Version control is the ability to keep track of changes to one or more of your documents (in GitHub's case, it can be for an entire project). In that sense, you can control the changes that go into your repository (GitHub's technical term for project), put a review process in place, comment on several changes, and make additional changes before you "release" your project.

# Getting Started

To get you started; you will first need to [create an account](https://github.com/join) or [sign in if you already have an account](https://github.com/login).

Once you have signed up/signed in, you can import a repository from [this link](https://github.com/new/import); or using the following steps:
* click on the add (+) button, which you can find to the left of your avatar on the top right.
* from the choices, choose 'Import repository'

From the 'Import repository' window, you will need to enter the url for this repository (https://github.com/rujick/the-template), as well as the name of your new repository. You will want to choose a name that represents your writing project.

The process should take a couple of minutes, after which you will be ready to start working on your project right away.
